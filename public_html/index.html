        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h3>What this page is about?</h3>
        <p>
            This page will describe the sieve task you need to complete in order to qualify as a front-end developer at Insured Oy for the vakuutustiedot.fi web service.
        </p>

        <h3>General description of the task</h3>
        <p>
            Informally, you need to create a web page that communicates with the backend via a WebSocket. 
            The idea is that all the users visiting your page can modify a shared list of devices. Each user can:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>add a new device to the shared list,</li>
            <li>edit the details of a device,</li>
            <li>remove a device from the shared list.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Most important requirement is that when any user works on the list, the remaining users see the changes immediately.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Device description</h3>
        <p>Each device is described by four fields:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>device ID,</li>
            <li>device name,</li>
            <li>device description,</li>
            <li>device status (on/off).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>All fields except the device ID are visible to the users.</p>
        
        <h1>The backend specification</h1>
        <p>The WebSocket endpoint is deployed at 
            <a href="wss://device-endpoint.herokuapp.com/devices">wss://device-endpoint.herokuapp.com/devices</a>. It communicates with the endpoint via JSON-formatted text.
        </p> 
        
        <h3>Operation specifications</h3>
        
        <h4>Adding a new device</h4>
        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>In order to request the endpoint to create a new device, you need to pass the following JSON-formatted message to it:</p>
        
        <h5>Synopsis</h5>
        <blockquote>
            <code>{"action":"create",
                   "deviceName":"Your device name",
                   "deviceDescription":"Your device description",
                   "deviceStatus":true}</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Above, <code>"action":"create"</code> tells the endpoint that we are adding a 
            new device, the values of the keys <code>"deviceName"</code> and 
            <code>"deviceDescription"</code> are the device name and description, 
            respectively. Whether to allow empty strings for the aforementioned values, 
            is up to you. Finally, the value of <code>"deviceStatus"</code> is a boolean value <code>true/false</code> corresponding whether the device is toggled off or on.</p>
        
        <h5>Endpoint response</h5>
        After sending an above message to the endpoint, the endpoint will respond with
        <blockquote>
            <code>{"succeeded":true,"message":"A device \"Your device name\" is successfully added.","action":"create","deviceId":10,"deviceName":"Your device name","deviceDescription":"Your device description","deviceStatus":true}</code>
        </blockquote>
        Since endpoint will never fail to create a device, the value of <code>"succeeded"</code> will be always <code>true</code>.
        The value of <code>"deviceId"</code> will, however, vary.
        
        <h5>Additional requirements</h5>
        <p>When any user adds a new device, the device in question appears in the view of any other user.</p>
        
        <h4>Editing an existing device</h4>
        <h5></h5>
        
        <h4>Removing an existing device</h4>
